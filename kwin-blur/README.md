kwin-blur
====

Modification of the kwin-5.12.4-1 package from the official "extra" repository.
This package is not a fork of the kwin-git AUR package and thus doesn't depend on other -git packages from the AUR.

Adds new blur effects, which have been added to kwin since 5.12.0.
Once kwin publishes a new release containing these changes, this packages can be removed.
