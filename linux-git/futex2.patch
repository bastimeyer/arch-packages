Subject: [PATCH 2/6] futex2: Implement vectorized wait
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add support to wait on multiple futexes. This is the interface
implemented by this syscall:

futex_waitv(struct futex_waitv *waiters, unsigned int nr_futexes,
	    unsigned int flags, struct timespec *timo)

struct futex_waitv {
	__u64 val;
	__u64 uaddr;
	__u32 flags;
	__u32 __reserved;
};

Given an array of struct futex_waitv, wait on each uaddr. The thread
wakes if a futex_wake() is performed at any uaddr. The syscall returns
immediately if any waiter has *uaddr != val. *timo is an optional
absolute timeout value for the operation. This syscall supports only
64bit sized timeout structs. The flags argument of the syscall should be
used solely for specifying the timeout clock as realtime, if needed.
Flags for shared futexes, sizes, etc. should be used on the individual
flags of each waiter.

__reserved is used for explicit padding and should be 0, but it might be
used for future extensions. If the userspace uses 32-bit pointers, it
should make sure to explicitly cast it when assigning to waitv::uaddr.

Returns the array index of one of the awakened futexes. There’s no given
information of how many were awakened, or any particular attribute of it
(if it’s the first awakened, if it is of the smaller index...).

Test if the futex_waitv timeout is working as expected, using the
supported clockid options.

Subject: [PATCH] futex2: Add sysfs entry for syscall numbers
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In the course of futex2 development, it will be rebased on top of
different kernel releases, and the syscall number can change in this
process. Expose futex2 syscall number via sysfs so tools that are
experimenting with futex2 (like Proton/Wine) can test it and set the
syscall number at runtime, rather than setting it at compilation time.
